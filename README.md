**2 Sentence Description**

Gnosis Chain is an Ethereum forerunner-companion that addresses scaling issues through solid engineering. It is the associated execution-layer EVM chain for stable transactions. It uses the xDai token and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users.

**Longer Description/ Mission**

Gnosis Chain uses the xDai token. It is the associated execution-layer EVM chain for stable transactions and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users.

Gnosis Chain offers seamless ETH compatibility without the prohibitive price tag of ETH gas fees. Experimentation and accessibility are guiding principles for Gnosis Chain. We will work hard to always keep 100k gas at $0.01, compared to the variable, current price of ~$12.70 per transaction on the Ethereum Mainnet. Projects priced out of building on ETH will be able to build and experiment once again on Gnosis Chain.

**Who We Are**

The Gnosis mission has always been centered on experimentation and building decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. When Gnosis was founded in 2015, it focused on building prediction markets to enable worldwide access to accurate information. While creating the prediction market platform, it became clear that Gnosis needed to build the infrastructure required to support it. Gnosis Safe, for example, was born of necessity.

As a DAO, Gnosis uses the products that it creates to transparently guide decisions on the development, support, and governance of its ecosystem.

Gnosis Safe (multisig and programmable account), Cow Protocol (formerly CowSwap and Gnosis Protocol), Conditional Tokens (prediction markets), Gnosis Auction, and Zodiac (standard and tooling for composable DAOs) are all products incubated by Gnosis. Their success is demonstrated by the recent spin-out of Cow Protocol and the formation of SafeDAO. By combining needs-driven development with deep technical expertise, Gnosis has built the decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem.
